      content="The objective of the project  is to report problems which we might be facing and we are not sure whether others find the same problem in their locations. Confirming and reaffirming that others are facing the same problem will be helpful. This is more appropriate in developing countries where people face these problems almost every week. People in developing countries often experience these problems and can find other people facing such problems. When powered with analytics, they can form petitions to the government if it is a recurring problem by building community. In developed countries, other problem types can be mentioned like smoke, air quality, parking, traffic etc."

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
